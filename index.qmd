Matt is a developmental and cellular biologist with an interest in understanding how cell-level processes shape organisms through genetic tools and live imaging. He is currently working on deciphering the mechanisms involved in balancing apoptosis and senescence in the short-lived African Turquoise Killifish, *Nothobranchius furzeri*. Outside of lab, Matt is an avid photographer, cook, and hiker.
